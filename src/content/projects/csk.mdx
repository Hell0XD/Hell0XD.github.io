        I worked on **ČSK**, a portal designed for **dentists** in the **Czech Republic**. It consists of a public section where users can access information on internships, dental offices, and other relevant resources. The private section of **ČSK** offers dentists interactive **forms** and contact directories, streamlining their administrative tasks and fostering professional connections. This user-friendly platform enhances efficiency and promotes exceptional patient care within the dental industry.
