        I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project called **Oneworld Online**, a captivating **video platform** dedicated to documentaries. One of the key highlights of **Oneworld Online** is its payment gateway, allowing users to easily purchase and **stream** documentaries from the comfort of their homes. The platform also boasts a **localized** video streaming feature, ensuring that english viewers  can enjoy a smooth and immersive experience. Additionally, users have the freedom to **rate** and **comment** on films. To further enhance the user experience, there is a voucher system that enables you to **purchase vouchers** for individual films or entire film packs, particularly beneficial during film festivals.
