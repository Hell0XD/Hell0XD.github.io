This was is long-term graduation thesis. It is a concept about how to create a full language with **compiler**,
**parser** and **VM** without any third-party dependecies. I created the whole project in **Rust** and splited it to multiple libraries to share
some code. The project website can be found [here](https://otlang.netlify.app/), on the website there are simple docs how to use the language
and in _Download_ section there are precompiled binaries for some platforms. You can try the language without the binaries in _Editor_
section (the compiler and vm is for the web compiled to **WASM**). The project source code can be found at [github.com/Hell0XD/otlang](https://github.com/Hell0XD/otlang)

        Many of the features of the language are easy syntax, **FFI**, good performance for dynamic language, **JIT compiler**, pattern matching, **tailcall** optimization and many more.

        ```lisp

            (defn F
                [0] 0
                [1] 1
                [n] (+ (F (- n 1)) (F (- n 2)))
            )


        ```
